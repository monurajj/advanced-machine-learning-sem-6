Q1

Shuffling removes the time order, so we lose how past values influence future values. Patterns like trend or seasonality disappear.

Q2

(b) Daily high temperature for the past month.

Time Index & Frequency
Q3

Frequency = every 10 minutes.
Benefit: real-time weather alerts or storm tracking.

Q4

Yearly or daily pattern analysis is not appropriate because monthly data hides short-term changes.

Trend
Q5

Business growth / more customers

Population increase / marketing expansion

Q6

A slow upward sloping line (steadily increasing curve).

Seasonality
Q7

Daily seasonality, because the pattern repeats every day.

Q8

Daily: website traffic

Weekly: weekend movie sales

Yearly: winter clothing sales

Noise
Q9

Noise, because it is random and not repeating.

Q10

Because noise hides real patterns, making trend/seasonality harder to detect.

Decomposition
Q11

Long-term change is small, but short-term cycles are strong.

Q12

Improves forecasting accuracy by modeling only the true underlying trend.

Identifying Components
Q13

(a) T + S
(b) N
(c) T + N

Q14

Suggests daily dependence (lag 1) and weekly seasonality (lag 7).

Visualization
Q15

(i) Trend → line plot with rolling average
(ii) Weekly seasonality → weekly grouped/box plot

Q16

Check those dates for special events

Look for data errors or outliers

Challenges
Q17

Yes, seasonality.
Period = 24.

Q18

Try piecewise trend model or change-point regression.

Q19

Multiplicative, because amplitude changes with time.

Q20

Example story:
Ice cream shop sales slowly fall over years, peak every summer, and sometimes jump suddenly during festivals or heatwaves.
